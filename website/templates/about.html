                                    I built this project to answer the most burning questions a younger version of
                                    myself had when I first got interested in markets, trading, and technical analysis
                                    many years ago – what’s the best technical strategy and how do I know it works?
                                    Before knowing anything about coding or basic backtesting methods, the only
                                    assurance I had that a particular trading strategy worked - out of hundreds of
                                    different strategies and tens of thousands of possible combinations of parameter
                                    inputs – was either the misguided/self-interested testimonial of a “guru” or by
                                    manually backtesting a single version of a single strategy over X periods of Y
                                    timeframe on Z asset. As one can imagine, this turned out to be incredibly time
                                    consuming, tedious, and inefficient. Since ain't nobody got time for that, the
                                    obvious answer was the let the computer do it.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I started with developing a single backtest for an easy technical based strategy.
                                    The concept was simple - input a handful of parameters and receive a list of
                                    trades taken as well as a few evaluation metrics to gauge performance. Once
                                    finished, I excitedly started inputting random parameter combinations and viewing
                                    the results. A few minutes later I hit the "ok, what now?" wall and came to the
                                    realization that this really didn't get me much closer to finding anything
                                    substantial. After all, there are thousands, if not millions of combinations of
                                    parameter inputs for any given strategy. How would I sort through them all to
                                    find the performers? Once again, I defaulted to the obvious answer
                                    - let the computer do it.

                                    what goes into it you can find the answer
